## JACQIE WILLIAMSON: PORTFOLIO
This my first attempt at designing a portfolio.
This piece of work should be considered as a 'work in progress' because as I develop my skills as a Developer, I will refine and add to this webpage.

#Please Note:
- I am aware that this web page is not sematically compliant as the vast majority of the tags are <div>'s
- The hyperlinks should take you to the appropriate section of the webpage
- The 'contact me' hyperlink should generate an email page enabling the user to send me an email. 
- Code to enable viewpoint responsiveness has been included in the stylesheet.
- An profile image of me has been included.
